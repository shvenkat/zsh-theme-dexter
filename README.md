# Dexter, a zsh theme.

A theme with an emphasis on the right (hand) side of the terminal.

The prompt looks like this (_ is your cursor):
```
%% _                                       [env] (master *%) ~/f/b/quux megatrâ€¦
```

The right prompt shows the following information from left to right, if the
required plugins are available:

* python virtualenv, using the virtualenv plugin (robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh)

* git status, using the gitfast plugin (robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh)

* fish-style working directory, using the shrink-path plugin
   (shvenkat/oh-my-zsh)

* abbreviated hostname
